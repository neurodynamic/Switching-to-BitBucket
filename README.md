Switching-to-BitBucket
======================

 I have made the decision to move my repositories to BitBucket, because some of the decisions that have been made by the GitHub team have, I feel, given cause for concern that their corporate culture may be actively harmful to the tech community as a whole. I am keeping my account here active, because it is not unlikely I may need this account to contribute to projects that only exist on GitHub in the future, but I will not be contributing any money to GitHub, and will be encouraging others to make similar switches to other services where possible in the future.
