Switching-to-BitBucket
======================

I have made the decision to move my repositories to [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/neurodynamic/), because some of the decisions that have been made by the GitHub team are, I feel, reason to believe that their corporate culture is actively harmful to the tech community as a whole. I am keeping my account here active, because it is not unlikely I may need this account to contribute to projects that only exist on GitHub in the future, but I will not be contributing any money to GitHub, will be avoiding hosting my own repositories here where possible, and will be encouraging others to make similar switches to other services where possible in the future.
